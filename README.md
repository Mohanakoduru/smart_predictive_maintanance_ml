# 🏗 Smart Predictive Maintenance System for Construction Materials

A **sensor-less, data-driven predictive maintenance system** that uses **machine learning** and **Explainable AI (Groq LLM)** to assess the condition of construction materials and generate **professional maintenance reports**.

---

## 📌 Overview

The Smart Predictive Maintenance System predicts the **condition and maintenance requirements** of construction materials such as **steel, cement, and bricks** using historical and usage data.  
To enhance interpretability, the system integrates **Explainable AI (Groq LLM)** to generate human-readable explanations and produces a **downloadable PDF maintenance report**.

This project demonstrates how **machine learning + AI reasoning** can support preventive maintenance decisions **without using sensors or IoT hardware**.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Construction materials degrade due to:
- Aging
- Environmental exposure (humidity)
- Usage frequency
- Load stress
- Delayed maintenance

Traditional maintenance is often manual and reactive, leading to increased cost and safety risks.  
This system provides a **predictive, software-only solution** for early maintenance planning.
